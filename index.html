        <h2 class="project-tagline">Student at Washington University in St. Louis</h2>
      </section>
      I am a current Class of 2016 BSBA candidate at the Olin Business School at Washington University in St. Louis. I am a marketing major with a minor in Communication Design.
      <br>
      <br>
 
Post-Graduation I plan on entering the fashion industry either doing marketing in a fashion brad or by becoming at agent at a modeling agency. Check my <b><a href="#section1">Work Experience</a></b> my <b><a href="#section2">Leadership</a></b> roles for more information on my professional background. 
<br>
<br>
When I’m not working with my on campus groups such as Mr. Wash. U., I am relaxing, looking up new and old trends in music and fashion as well as keeping up with popular culture.
<br>
<br>
From my interests, I have been apart of the creation of two fan sites, <a href="http://www.thebeyhive.com/board/" target="_blank">The BeyHive</a> and <a href="http://chanelimandaily.net/" target="_blank">Chanel Iman Daily</a>. Currently, I am the Webmaster of Chanel Iman Daily. For more information, check out the <b><a href="#section3">Websites</a></b> section. I am taking Web Development to better understand HTML and CSS to be a more efficient Webmaster.
