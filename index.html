      I am a current Class of 2016 BSBA candidate at the Olin Business School at Washington University in St. Louis. I am a marketing major with a minor in Communication Design.
      <br>
 
Post-Graduation I plan on entering the fashion industry either doing marketing in a fashion brad or by becoming at agent at a modeling agency. Check my work experience for more information on my professional background. 
<br>
When Iâ€™m not working with my on campus groups such as Mr. Wash. U., I am relaxing, looking up new and old trends in music and fashion as well as keeping up with popular culture.
<br>
From my interests, I have been apart of the creation of two fan sites, The BeyHive and Chanel Iman Daily. Currently, I am the Webmaster of Chanel Iman Daily.  I am taking Web Development to better understand HTML and CSS to be a more efficient Webmaster.
